# breweryList

A project formed as a week-long coding challenge for RSM powered by the OpenBreweryDB API.

Allows searches to be made for breweries listed in the US, queried by city.


# How to set up

- `npm install --force` (I know, probably not cool)
- `npm start`


# Technologies used

- React
- MaterialUI
- Webpack/Babel for transpiling


# Future considerations

- Build up a custom back-end with breweries saved in Postgres. Implement a way to switch between OpenBreweryDB and the custom back end (and try to make it look cool).
- Make my own custom funny icons to add a personal touch.
- Take screenshots of the breweries and mint them to the blockchain (???)
